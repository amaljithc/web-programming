Web development comes with a huge set of rules and techniques
 every website developer should know about. If you want a website
 to look and function as you wish them to, you need to get familiar
 with web technologies that will help you achieve your goal.
 Developing an app or a website typically comes down to knowing
 3 main languages: JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. 
And while it sounds quite complicated, once you know what you are doing,
 understanding web technology and the way it works becomes significantly easier.
 We present you with an introduction to web technologies
 and the latest web technologies list hoping it will make things at least a bit easier for you.
 Now, let’s take a look.

<p >
<h3><br>
You have probably heard the term “web development technologies” before, but did you ever think about what it actually means?
<br><br><br>
Since computers can’t communicate with each other the way people do, they require codes instead. Web technologies are the markup languages and multimedia packages computers use to communicate.

<center><h2>Browsers </h2></center>
<p >
<h3><br>
Browsers request information and then they show us in the way we can understand. Think of them as the interpreters of the web. Here are the most popular ones:
<br><br><br>
<font color="sky blue">Google Chrome </font>–Currently, the most popular browser brought to you by Google
<br><br>
<font color="sky blue">Safari  </font>– Apple’s web browser
<br><br>
<font color="sky blue">Firefox </font>– Open-source browser supported by the Mozilla Foundation
<br><br>
<font color="sky blue">Internet Explorer </font>– Microsoft’s browser
<br><br>

<center><h2>HTML & CSS </h2></center>
<p >
<h3><br>
HTML is one of the first you should learn. Thanks to HTML, the web browsers know what to show once they receive the request. If you want to better understand how HTML works, you also need to know what CSS is
<br><br><br>
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on the screen. If you browse enough tutorials, you’ll soon create CSS text effects, page transitions, image hover effects, and more. 
<br><br><br>
If you’re a complete beginner, this Essential HTML & CSS training by James Williamson will help you to quickly get started with these technologies.

<center><h2>Web Development Frameworks</h2></center>
<p >
<h3><br>
Web development frameworks are a starting point of items that a developer can use to avoid doing the simple or mundane tasks, and instead get right to work.
<br><br><br>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Angular is one of the latest web technologies designed specifically for developing dynamic web applications. With this framework, you can easily create front-end based applications without needing to use other frameworks or plugins.
<br><br>The features include well-made templates, MVC architecture, code generation, code splitting etc. All the expressions are like code snippets that enclosed within curly braces and do not use any loops or conditional statements.
</li>
<li>Ruby on Rails is a server-side website technology that makes app development much easier and faster. The thing that really sets this framework apart is the reusability of the code as well as some other cool features that will help you get the job done in no time. <br><br>
Popular websites written with Ruby include Basecamp, Ask.fm, GitHub, 500px, and many others.
</li>
<li> Yii is an open-source web application development framework built in PHP5. It is performance-optimized and comes with a number of great tools for debugging and app testing. Another plus is that it is pretty simple and easy to use.<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
